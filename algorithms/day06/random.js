var floor = Math.floor(1.8); // 1
var ceiling = Math.ceil( Math.PI ); // 3.14.. // 4

// Dice Roller
// Using what we've learned about the Math library in JavaScript, complete the following function that should return a value between 1 through 6 at random.

function d6() {
    var roll = Math.random(); // 0 - 0.999999
    // your code here
    return roll;
}
    
var playerRoll = d6();
console.log("The player rolled: " + playerRoll);
