          <article>
            <h3>Classless / Minimalist:</h3>
            <h4>Learning curve: Low, CSS file size: Light</h4>

            <p>
              These frameworks offer a minimal set of styles and components,
              focusing on simplicity and flexibility. They provide a starting
              point for customization rather than a complete UI solution.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you're concerned about page load times and performance, a
              lightweight framework can be beneficial. These frameworks
              typically have smaller file sizes and fewer dependencies,
              resulting in faster loading times for your web pages. They focus
              on essential styles and components, minimizing the impact on
              performance.
            </p>

              Project Prototyping: When building a quick prototype or proof of
              concept, a lightweight framework can help you get started rapidly.
              Its minimalistic approach allows you to set up a basic structure
              and layout quickly, allowing you to focus more on the core
              functionality or design aspects of your project.

            <h3>Utility-First / Atomic:</h3>
            <h4>
              Learning curve: High, CSS file size: Light (if configured with
              postcss/purgecss)
            </h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a>

            </ul>
            <p>
              Atomic CSS libraries follow a modular approach, where styles are
              broken down into small, single-purpose utility classes. These
              classes represent individual styling properties, such as margin,
              padding, typography, colors, and positioning. The primary
              advantage of atomic CSS is that it allows for highly modular and
              reusable styles. This approach is beneficial when you want to
              create a large number of consistent and reusable styles across
              your project.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are building a custom design system for your project, an
              atomic CSS library can be a valuable tool. Atomic classes provide
              a shared language for defining and applying styles across your
              design system, ensuring visual consistency and ease of
              maintenance. It allows you to create a cohesive set of reusable
              styles that can be used consistently throughout your project.
            </p>
            <p>
              Atomic CSS libraries offer a standardized set of utility classes
              that can be easily understood and adopted by a development team.
              This promotes consistency in styling and facilitates collaboration
              among team members, as they can quickly grasp and apply the atomic
              classes without extensive knowledge of CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
              Atomic CSS libraries excel in rapid prototyping scenarios. Since
              atomic classes are focused on specific styling properties, you can
              quickly assemble and apply them to elements without the need to
              write custom CSS rules. This speeds up the prototyping process,
              allowing you to iterate and experiment with different styles and
              layouts easily.
            </p>

            <h3>Comprehensive / General Purpose:</h3>
            <h4>
              Learning curve: Mid, CSS file size: Mid-to-heavy, but can be light
              if configured with postcss/purgecss
            </h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>
              </li>
              <li>

            </ul>
            <p>
              These frameworks provide a wide range of pre-designed components,
              layouts, and utility classes for building complete websites or web
              applications. They often include CSS, JavaScript, and sometimes
              additional tools for tasks like responsive design and
              cross-browser compatibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you want to maintain a consistent design language and user
              experience throughout your project, a comprehensive framework can
              be beneficial. They often come with a unified set of styles,
              components, and design patterns, ensuring a cohesive look and feel
              across different pages and sections of your website.
            </p>
            <p>
              Comprehensive frameworks typically have built-in support for
              responsive design. They offer responsive grids, responsive
              navigation menus, and responsive utilities that make it easier to
              create websites that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
              If your project requires a mobile-friendly and responsive layout,
              these frameworks can save you time and effort.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you need to quickly prototype a concept or create a minimum
              viable product (MVP), a comprehensive framework can provide a
              solid foundation. The pre-built components and layouts allow you
              to rapidly assemble the necessary features and test your idea
              without spending excessive time on styling and design.
